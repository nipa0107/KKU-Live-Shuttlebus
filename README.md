As a mini-project for the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course, I designed and validated a prototype for a Khon Kaen University (KKU) shuttle bus application. The primary goal was to conceptualize and test a user-friendly interface to improve the campus shuttle experience. This project involved creating wireframes and high-fidelity mockups using Adobe XD, followed by usability testing with 8 participants to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. The project focused on design and validation, without proceeding to actual development.
