![KKULiveShuttlebus](KKULiveShuttlebus.gif)

A mobile app prototype designed to improve the shuttle bus experience at Khon Kaen University (KKU).  
This was developed as a **mini-project** for the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course, focusing on **UI/UX design** and **usability validation**.

## 🎯 Project Objective

I designed a mobile application interface for the Khon Kaen University (KKU) shuttle bus system to be user-friendly and efficient, helping users track buses in real-time.
This project began in my first year as an initiative to address issues found in the original KKU Transit app, such as inaccurate real-time tracking and a user experience that did not meet user needs.
I collaborated with the team to redesign the interface with a strong focus on solving usability problems by improving clarity, ease of use, and the reliability of displayed information.
